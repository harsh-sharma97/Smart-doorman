IOT based MDD project
Before the use of  smart lock system



 1.  you could not supervise your home if you were
out.



 2.  you could not keep track who enters or exits your
home.



 3.  burglary was widely possible.



After



- All the things stated above
are now possible by using actuators and sensors and other computation methods.

These exist few products in area of smart locking system but most of
them are in collaboration with the smart home package which costs a fortune. Moreover
adding these edits will make it widely usable.



Edits:

1)Introducing doorbells that
give notification on your smartphone rather than ringing out loud at homes or
in fact doing both will be very effective as we tend to be closer to our mobile
phones than our partners nowadays.
2)changing the security key for
the lock on a daily basis could be one possible attempt to ensure security.


Drawback:
If one gets the access to the remote , that is the users cell phone he will be out in
the open. the price godrej charges is around 20,000+ for full setup. originally
there were no such atribute just a lock and a doorbell costing around 4-5k rs.
now with the aided benefits anyone will be willing to spend a decent amount on
their security.
